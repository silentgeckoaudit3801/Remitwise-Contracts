Shared Components

remitwise-common

A common crate containing shared types, enums, constants, and utilities used across multiple contracts.

**Shared Types:**
- `Category`: Financial categories (Spending, Savings, Bills, Insurance)
- `FamilyRole`: Access control roles (Owner, Admin, Member, Viewer)
- `CoverageType`: Insurance coverage types (Health, Life, Property, Auto, Liability)
- `EventCategory` & `EventPriority`: Event logging categories and priorities
- `PauseState`: Structured pause state carrying `paused: bool` and `paused_since: Option<u64>` for analytics

**Shared Constants:**
- Pagination limits (`DEFAULT_PAGE_LIMIT`, `MAX_PAGE_LIMIT`)
- Storage TTL values (`INSTANCE_LIFETIME_THRESHOLD`, `ARCHIVE_LIFETIME_THRESHOLD`, etc.)
- Pause storage key (`STORAGE_PAUSED_AT`)
- Contract versioning (`CONTRACT_VERSION`)
- Batch operation limits (`MAX_BATCH_SIZE`)

**Shared Utilities:**
- `clamp_limit()`: Helper for pagination limit validation
- `verify_ordered_pair()`: Helper for range validation
- `RemitwiseEvents`: Standardized event emission with `emit()` and `emit_batch()` methods

- Pagination limits ("DEFAULT_PAGE_LIMIT", "MAX_PAGE_LIMIT").
- Storage TTL values ("INSTANCE_LIFETIME_THRESHOLD", "ARCHIVE_LIFETIME_THRESHOLD", etc.).
- Contract versioning ("CONTRACT_VERSION").
- Batch operation limits ("MAX_BATCH_SIZE").

Shared Utilities

- "clamp_limit()": Validates and clamps pagination limits.
- "validate_period()": Validates the logical ordering of start and end periods.
- "same_address()": Compares two Soroban "Address" values without requiring callers to clone an address solely for equality checks.
- "RemitwiseEvents": Provides standardized event emission through "emit()" and "emit_batch()".

"same_address()" Helper

The "same_address()" helper provides a consistent way to compare two Soroban "Address" values while avoiding unnecessary address cloning at call sites.

Use the helper when comparing addresses:

if same_address(&owner, &caller) {
    // Address values match.
}

The helper is intended to:

- Improve readability of address comparisons.
- Reduce accidental ".clone()" calls used only to perform equality checks.
- Provide a shared comparison pattern across contracts.
- Preserve backwards compatibility with existing public contract APIs.

The helper does not change the semantics of address equality and does not modify or normalize either address.

Shared Enums & Constants Stability Coverage

This project includes dedicated compatibility guards in "remitwise-common" to prevent breaking changes across dependent contracts.

Coverage includes:

- Invariant tests for enum discriminants and event tags.
- Ordering assumptions verified for role and coverage definitions.
- Round-trip serialization via "soroban_sdk::IntoVal" and "TryFromVal".
- Event topic and payload serialization checks for "RemitwiseEvents".
- Pagination and TTL constant stability assertions.

Running the Compatibility Coverage

cargo test -p remitwise-common

Focused test recipe

Use the repository `justfile` to run one focused Cargo test by substring while
keeping the same workspace dependency resolution as the full suite:

```bash
just test-one emit_audit
```

The recipe expands to `cargo test --workspace <pattern>`. It rejects an empty
pattern before Cargo starts and prints `usage: just test-one <pattern>`, so it
is safe to re-run while narrowing a failing test.

Security Notes

- Enums use "#[repr(u32)]" and are asserted in tests, reducing the risk of contract integration drift.
- Shared constants used for pagination, batch size, storage TTL, and signature timeout are protected by stability checks.
- "clamp_limit()" includes explicit tests for overflow, underflow, and boundary conditions.
- "same_address()" is covered by tests for equal and unequal address values.

CLI Tool

A custom Rust CLI is provided for interacting with the contracts without a UI.

See "cli/README.md" (cli/README.md) for usage instructions.

Additional Components

- indexer: TypeScript event indexer for off-chain querying and analytics. See "indexer/README.md" (indexer/README.md).
- analytics: On-chain analytics and reporting.
- orchestrator: Cross-contract coordination.
- reporting: Financial reporting and insights.

Entrypoint Auth Inventory

Use the helper script below to print every public contract entrypoint alongside its detected authorization model:

python3 scripts/entrypoint_auth_inventory.py
python3 scripts/entrypoint_auth_inventory.py remittance_split

This is useful for reviewers who want a quick inventory of which entrypoints are authenticated, read-only, or otherwise permissionless.

Prerequisites

- Rust (latest stable version).
- Stellar CLI ("soroban-cli").
- Cargo.

1. Review Release Notes

Check the Soroban SDK releases for:

- Breaking changes in contract APIs.
- New features or optimizations.
- Deprecated functions.
- Protocol version requirements.

2. Update Dependencies

Update the SDK version in all applicable contract "Cargo.toml" files:

[dependencies]
soroban-sdk = "X.Y.Z"

[dev-dependencies]
soroban-sdk = { version = "X.Y.Z", features = ["testutils"] }

Contracts to update include:

- "remittance_split/Cargo.toml"

soroban version

4. Run the Full Test Suite

cargo clean
cargo test
./scripts/run_gas_benchmarks.sh

5. Validate on Testnet

Build optimized contracts:

cargo build --release --target wasm32-unknown-unknown

Deploy a contract:

soroban contract deploy \
  --wasm target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/<contract_name>.wasm \
  --source <your-key> \
  --network testnet

Test a contract interaction:

soroban contract invoke \
  --id <contract-id> \

  --network testnet \
  -- <function-name> <args>

6. Check for Breaking Changes

Common breaking changes to watch for include:

- Storage API changes, including TTL and archival patterns.
- Event emission and topic structure changes.
- Authorization and signature verification changes.
- Numeric type changes involving "i128", "u128", or fixed-point math.
- Contract lifecycle and upgrade pattern changes.

7. Update Documentation

After successful validation:

- Update this compatibility section with new versions.
- Document migration steps in "DEPLOYMENT.md".
- Update code examples if APIs change.
- Regenerate contract bindings if necessary.

Known Breaking Changes

SDK 21.0.0

No known breaking changes from the previous stable version affecting these contracts.

Future Considerations

- Protocol 21+: May introduce new storage pricing or TTL requirements.
- SDK 22.0.0+: Monitor for changes to contract storage patterns, event APIs, or authorization flows.

Installation

Install the Soroban CLI:

cargo install --locked --version 21.0.0 soroban-cli

Build all contracts:

cargo build --release --target wasm32-unknown-unknown

- Ensure CLI version matches SDK version
- Verify network is running compatible protocol version
- Check for new deployment flags or requirements

Orchestrator

Coordinates cross-contract operations and end-to-end remittance flows.

See "orchestrator/README.md" (orchestrator/README.md) for detailed functionality and integration guidance.

Emergency Killswitch

Provides centralized emergency pause controls across supported contracts.

See "emergency_killswitch/README.md" (emergency_killswitch/README.md) for detailed functionality and operational procedures.

Events

All contracts emit events for important state changes, enabling real-time tracking and frontend integration.

Events follow Soroban best practices and include:

- Relevant IDs: Events include the ID of the entity being acted upon where applicable.
- Amounts: Financial events include transaction amounts where applicable.
- Timestamps: Events include the ledger timestamp where applicable.
- Context Data: Additional contextual information such as names, dates, and references.

Event Topics

Each contract uses short symbol topics for efficient event identification:

- Remittance Split: "init", "calc"
- Savings Goals: "created", "added", "completed"
- Bill Payments: "created", "paid", "recurring"
- Insurance: "created", "paid", "deactive"
- Family Wallet: "added", "member", "updated", "limit", "emerg/*", "wallet/*"

Querying Events

Events can be queried from the Stellar network using the Soroban SDK or supported RPC/event-indexing infrastructure.

Each event structure is exported according to the relevant contract interface and can be decoded using the contract schema.

Testing

Run tests for all contracts:

cargo test

Issue #1141: "same_address()" Helper

The "same_address()" helper is covered by unit tests to ensure:

- Two identical addresses return "true".
- Two different addresses return "false".
- Address comparison does not require unnecessary caller-side cloning.
- Existing contract behaviour remains unchanged.

Run the shared utility tests:

```bash
python3 scripts/verify_cross_contract_invariants.py
```

See [scripts/README_INVARIANT_TESTS.md](scripts/README_INVARIANT_TESTS.md) for details.

### USDC remittance split checks (local & CI)

- `cargo test -p remittance_split` exercises the USDC distribution logic with a mocked Stellar Asset Contract (`env.register_stellar_asset_contract_v2`) and built-in auth mocking.
- The suite covers minting the payer account, splitting across spending/savings/bills/insurance, and asserting balances along with the new allocation metadata helper.
- The same command is intended for CI so it runs without manual setup; re-run locally whenever split logic changes or new USDC paths are added.

### Orchestrator audit log pagination correctness

The orchestrator audit API (`get_audit_log(from_index, limit)`) supports cursor-based pagination for compliance and monitoring clients.

**Pagination guarantees:**
- Results are ordered from oldest to newest in the current bounded audit window.
- `from_index` is a stable zero-based cursor within that bounded window.
- `limit` is clamped to contract maximum capacity (`MAX_AUDIT_ENTRIES`) for predictable gas and memory usage.
- Page-end calculation uses saturating arithmetic to prevent cursor overflow edge cases.
- Out-of-range cursors return an empty page (safe default).

**Security assumptions and notes:**
- Consumers should treat the cursor as a position in the current rotated window, not an immutable global ID.
- Log rotation drops oldest records at capacity, so clients should read promptly and persist externally if long-term retention is required.
- Tests assert no duplicate entries across sequential pages under heavy execution history and rotation pressure.

Run orchestrator tests (including pagination correctness coverage):

```bash
cargo test -p orchestrator
```

## Gas Benchmarks

RemitWise includes a comprehensive gas benchmarking harness for tracking and optimizing contract performance.

### Quick Start

Run all benchmarks and generate a JSON report:

```bash
./scripts/run_gas_benchmarks.sh
```

This creates `gas_results.json` with CPU and memory costs for all contract operations.

### Regression Detection

Compare current results against baseline to detect performance regressions:

```bash
./scripts/compare_gas_results.sh benchmarks/baseline.json gas_results.json
```

The comparison fails if CPU or memory increases exceed configured thresholds (default 10%).

### Update Baseline

After verifying optimizations:

```bash
./scripts/update_baseline.sh
```

### Documentation

- **[Benchmarking Guide](benchmarks/README.md)**: Complete benchmarking documentation
- **[Gas Unit Costs Reference](docs/GAS_UNIT_COSTS.md)**: Per-operation CPU/memory costs, fee formulas, and current network parameters
- **[Gas Tuning Guide](docs/GAS_TUNING.md)**: How to interpret gas snapshots and optimize costs
- **[Gas Optimization Guide](docs/gas-optimization.md)**: Optimization strategies and best practices
- **[Baseline Results](benchmarks/baseline.json)**: Current performance baseline
- **[Threshold Configuration](benchmarks/thresholds.json)**: Regression detection thresholds

### CI Integration

Gas benchmarks run automatically in CI on every push and pull request. Results are:

- Compared against baseline for regression detection
- Uploaded as artifacts (retained for 30 days)
- Posted as PR comments with comparison details

To view CI results:

1. Go to Actions tab in GitHub
2. Select a workflow run
3. Download the `gas-benchmarks` artifact
4. View `gas_results.json` for metrics

### Individual Contract Benchmarks

Run benchmarks for a specific contract:

```bash
RUST_TEST_THREADS=1 cargo test -p bill_payments --test gas_bench -- --nocapture
RUST_TEST_THREADS=1 cargo test -p savings_goals --test gas_bench -- --nocapture
RUST_TEST_THREADS=1 cargo test -p insurance --test gas_bench -- --nocapture
RUST_TEST_THREADS=1 cargo test -p family_wallet --test gas_bench -- --nocapture
RUST_TEST_THREADS=1 cargo test -p remittance_split --test gas_bench -- --nocapture
```

## Deployment

### Automated Bootstrap Deployment

The fastest way to deploy all contracts with sensible defaults:

```bash
# Deploy to testnet with default settings
./scripts/bootstrap_deploy.sh testnet deployer

# Skip building if contracts are already built
SKIP_BUILD=1 ./scripts/bootstrap_deploy.sh testnet deployer

# Deploy to mainnet
./scripts/bootstrap_deploy.sh mainnet deployer

# Custom output file location
OUTPUT_FILE=./my-contracts.json ./scripts/bootstrap_deploy.sh testnet deployer
```

The bootstrap script will:
1. Build all WASM artifacts (unless SKIP_BUILD=1)
2. Deploy each contract via soroban-cli
3. Initialize contracts with sensible defaults:
   - Remittance split: 50% spending, 30% savings, 15% bills, 5% insurance
   - One example savings goal
   - One example bill
   - One example insurance policy
4. Output contract IDs in a JSON file (default: `deployed-contracts.json`)

The generated JSON file can be easily consumed by frontend/backend:

```json
{
  "network": "testnet",
  "deployer": "GXXXXXXX...",
  "deployed_at": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
  "contracts": {
    "remittance_split": "CXXXXXXX...",
    "savings_goals": "CXXXXXXX...",
    "bill_payments": "CXXXXXXX...",
    "insurance": "CXXXXXXX...",
    "family_wallet": "CXXXXXXX...",
    "reporting": "CXXXXXXX...",
    "orchestrator": "CXXXXXXX..."
  }
}
```

### Manual Deployment

See the [Deployment Guide](DEPLOYMENT.md) for comprehensive manual deployment instructions.

Quick deploy to testnet:

```bash
soroban contract deploy \
  --wasm target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/remittance_split.wasm \
  --source <your-key> \
  --network testnet
```

## Data Migration

The `data_migration` payload library provides format-agnostic snapshot export/import capabilities across all contracts.

### Import Replay Protection

When importing payloads, the contracts use a `MigrationTracker` to prevent duplicate imports and replay attacks.
- Payload Identity is cryptographically bound to a `(checksum, version)` tuple.
- The state tracker persists this tuple alongside the ingestion `timestamp_ms` to outright reject replayed or copied payloads using `MigrationError::DuplicateImport`.
- Restores are safely guarded against double spending or overriding the active state multiple times.

## Operational Limits

ID and record-count operating limits (including `u32` overflow analysis and monitoring alerts) are documented in the **Operational Limits and Monitoring** section of [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md).

## Development

This is a basic MVP implementation. Future enhancements:

- Integration with Stellar Asset Contract (USDC)
- Cross-contract calls for automated allocation
- Multi-signature support for family wallets
- Emergency mode with priority processing

## Security

### Threat Model

A comprehensive security review and threat model is available in [THREAT_MODEL.md](THREAT_MODEL.md). This document identifies:

Feature Flag Consistency

The CI pipeline includes a feature flag consistency check:

python3 scripts/check_features.py

This verifies that every "cfg(feature = "...")" reference in Rust source code has a corresponding entry in the crate's "[features]" section.

Encrypted Migration Payload Decode Safety

The "data_migration" crate supports an opaque encrypted payload transport format for off-chain migration tooling.

Format

enc:v1:<base64>

Where:

- "enc:v1:" is a strict marker prefix.
- "<base64>" is the base64-encoded ciphertext blob.
